Props getters, very much like props collection, provide a collection of props to users of your component/hook. The difference being the provision of a getter - a function invoked to return the collection of props.
The added advantage a prop getter has is it can be invoked with arguments to override or extend the collection of props returned. for example the user specific values may be passed in.
