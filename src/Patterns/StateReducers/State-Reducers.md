Like the control props pattern, state reducers allow you to cede state control to the users of your component. Also, by leveraging action types, you minimise code duplicates on the user's side.

## Pros

- Ultimate Inversion of Control - State reducers in more complicated use cases are the best way to cede control over to the users of your component/custom hook.

## Cons

- Complexity - The pattern is arguably the most complex of the bunch to implement.
